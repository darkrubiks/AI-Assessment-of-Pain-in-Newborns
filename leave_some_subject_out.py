This code is responsible for creating the folds for training and testing. The
folds are created based on the leave some sobject out method developed during
Coutrin's Masters Degree, ensuring the same number of UNIFESP and COPE images
are used during training and testing, and also preventing subject leakage from
training to testing set. Only pain and no pain classifications are used.
